<h5>Instructions</h5>


<ol>

<li>Roast the Cajun Potatoes
Preheat your oven to 200°C (180°C fan) / 400°F / Gas 6.<br>

In a bowl, toss the potato chunks with Cajun seasoning and 1 tbsp olive oil.<br>

Spread them out on a lined baking tray and roast for 25–30 minutes, turning halfway through, until golden and crisp.</li><br>


<li>Make the Spicy Slaw
In a large bowl, combine shredded red cabbage and finely sliced red onion.<br>

In a smaller bowl, mix mayonnaise, soured cream, and chipotle chilli paste.<br>

Pour the dressing over the vegetables and mix well. Season with salt and pepper to taste.<br>

Chill in the fridge while you cook the steak.</li><br>

<li> Cook the Steak
Pat the bavette steak dry with kitchen paper. Rub with 1 tbsp olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper.<br>

Heat a heavy-bottomed frying pan or grill pan over high heat until very hot.<br>

Sear the steak for about 3–4 minutes per side for medium-rare, or adjust according to your preferred doneness.<br>

Remove from heat and let rest for 5–7 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li><br>
