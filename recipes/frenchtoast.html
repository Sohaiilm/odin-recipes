<h4><em>French Toast Step-by-Step Instructions see below:</em></h4>


<h5>Instructions</h5>

<ol>

<li>Make the custard base<br>
In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla, cinnamon, sugar (if using), and a pinch of salt until smooth</li><br>

<li>Soak the bread<br>
Dip each slice of bread into the mixture, allowing it to soak for a few seconds per side. Be gentle to avoid breaking the slices.</li><br>

<li>Cook the French toast<br>
Heat a nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a little butter or oil.<br>
Place soaked bread in the pan and cook for 2–3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crisp.</li><br>

<li>Serve warm<br>
Stack the French toast on a plate and top with your favorite additions—syrup, fruit, whipped cream, or a dusting of powdered sugar.</li><br>
</ol>
<h4>Tips:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Day-old or slightly stale bread works best—it absorbs the custard without getting soggy.</li>
<li>For extra flavor, try using a dash of nutmeg or a flavored extract like almond or hazelnut.</li>
<li>Want a richer version? Use half-and-half or cream instead of milk.</li><br>
</ul>


<p>Whether you enjoy it stacked high with berries and maple syrup or kept simple with a dusting of sugar and a pat of butter, French toast is the kind of comfort food that brings joy to any table. It's easy to make, endlessly customizable, and perfect for lazy weekends, special brunches, or even a cozy breakfast-for-dinner treat. With its golden crust, soft custardy center, and that irresistible aroma of vanilla and cinnamon, this dish is sure to become a favorite in your kitchen.</p>
